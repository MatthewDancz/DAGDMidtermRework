DAGD 420 Applied Simulation Midterm
===================================

Summary
-------
This project includes several different Processing Sketches. Each is a different simulation that shows off aspects of game math.
The primary processing projects for this project are GraphicDistortion, RedBoxChase, and VecAddNSub.

GraphicDistortion
-----------------
This Sketch shows off how a matrix can be used to modify how objects on the screen are drawn relative to the origin.

RedBoxChase
-----------
This Sketch shows off how AABB collision detection can be used to detect collisions with a red button.

VecAddNSub
----------
This Sketch shows off the resultant vector of adding and subtracting two vectors.
